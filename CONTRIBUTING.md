## Kotatsu contribution guidelines

+ If you want to **fix bugs** or **implement new features** that **already have an [issue card](https://github.com/Kotatsu-Redo/Kotatsu-Redo/issues):** please assign this issue to you and/or comment about it.
+ If you want to **implement a new feature:** open an issue or discussion regarding it to ensure it will be accepted.
+ In case you want to **add a new manga source,** refer to the [parsers repository](https://github.com/Kotatsu-Redo/kotatsu-parsers-redo).

**Refactoring** or some **dev-faces improvements** might also be accepted. However, please stick to the following principles:

+ **Performance matters.** In the case of choosing between source code beauty and performance, performance should be a priority. 
+ Please, **do not modify readme and other information files** (except for typos).
+ **Avoid adding new dependencies** unless required. APK size is important.
